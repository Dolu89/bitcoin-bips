## Abstract

This BIP defines a sane hierarchy for deterministic multisig wallets
based on an algorithm described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on), purpose
scheme described in BIP-0043 (BIP43 from now on), and multi-account
hierarchy described in BIP-0044 (BIP44 from now on).

This BIP is a particular application of BIP43.

## Motivation

With the increase of more user friendly (offline) multisignature
wallets, and adoption of new technologies such as [the descriptor
language](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
and [BIP-0174 (Partially Signed Bitcoin
Transactions)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki),
it is necessary to create a common derivation scheme that makes use of
all new technologies.

As background, BIP 44/49/84 specifies:

    m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index

where the BIP43 `purpose'` path is separate for each script (P2PKH,
P2WPKH-in-P2SH, and P2WPKH respectively). Having a script-per-derivation
for single sig wallets allows for easy backup and restore, with just the
private key information.

Multisignature wallets need more information to backup and restore (such
as all cosigner public keys), and these per-script derivations are made
redundant with descriptors, which provide that information (while also
specifying a collection of output scripts). A modern standardization is
needed for multisig derivation paths. There are some in existence, but
all have issues. For example, BIP45 specifies:

    m / purpose' / cosigner_index / change / address_index

BIP45 unecessarily demands a single script type (here, P2SH). In
addition, BIP45 sets `cosigner_index` in order to sort the `purpose'`
public keys of each cosigner. This too is redundant, as descriptors can
set the order of the public keys with `multi` or have them sorted
lexicographically (as described in
[BIP67](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0067.mediawiki))
with `sortedmulti`. Sorting public keys between cosigners in order to
create the full derivation path, prior to sending the key record to the
coordinator to create the descriptor, merely adds additional unnecessary
communication rounds.

The second multisignature "standard" in use is m/48', which specifies:

    m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / script_type' / change / address_index

Rather than following in BIP 44/49/84's path and having a separate BIP
per script after P2SH (BIP45), vendors decided to insert `script_type'`
into the derivation path (where P2SH-P2WSH=1, P2WSH=2, Future\_Script=3,
etc). As described previously, this is unnecessary, as the descriptor
sets the script. While it attempts to reduce maintainence work by
getting rid of new BIPs-per-script, it still requires maintaining an
updated, redundant, `script_type` list.

The structure proposed later in this paper solves these issues and is
quite comprehensive. It allows for the handling of multiple accounts,
external and internal chains per account, and millions of addresses per
chain, in a multi-party, multisignature, hierarchical deterministic
wallet regardless of the script type [1].

This paper was inspired from BIP44.

## Specification

### Key sorting

Any wallet that supports descriptors inherently supports deterministic
key sorting as per BIP67 (through the `sortedmulti` function) so that
all possible multisignature addresses/scripts are derived from
deterministically sorted public keys.

### Path levels

We should not be mixing keys and scripts in the same layer. The wallet
should create extended private/public keys independent of the script
type, whereas the descriptor language tells wallets to watch the
multisig outputs with the specified public keys.

We define the following 5 levels in the BIP32 path:

    m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index

`h` or `'` in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.

Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.

### Purpose

Purpose is a constant set to `87'` following the BIP43 recommendation.
It indicates that the subtree of this node is used according to this
specification.

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

### Coin type

One master node (seed) can be used for multiple Bitcoin networks.
Sharing the same space for various networks has some disadvantages.

This level creates a separate subtree for every network, avoiding
reusing addresses across networks and improving privacy issues.

Coin type `0` for mainnet and `1` for testnets (testnet, regtest, and
signet).

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

### Account

This level splits the key space into independent user identities,
following the BIP44 pattern, so the wallet never mixes the coins across
different accounts.

Users can use these accounts to organize the funds in the same fashion
as bank accounts; for donation purposes (where all addresses are
considered public), for saving purposes, for common expenses, etc.

Accounts are numbered from index `0` in sequentially increasing manner.
This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

It is crucial that this level is increased for each new wallet joined or
private/public keys created; for both privacy and cryptographic
purposes. For example, before sending a new key record to a coordinator,
the wallet must increment the `account'` level. This prevents key reuse
- across ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, across different script types,
and inbetween the same wallet types.

### Change

Constant `0` is used for external chain and constant `1` for internal
chain (also known as change addresses). External chain is used for
addresses that are meant to be visible outside of the wallet (e.g. for
receiving payments). Internal chain is used for addresses which are not
meant to be visible outside of the wallet and is used for return
transaction change.

Public derivation is used at this level.

### Index

Addresses are numbered from index `0` in sequentially increasing manner.
This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.

Public derivation is used at this level.

## Address Discovery

The multisig descriptors or descriptor template that is generated from
the cosigners' combined key records should be used to generate and
discover addresses.

Please see [BIP-0129 (Bitcoin Secure Multisig
Setup)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki)
for an introduction on descriptor templates. The descriptor or
descriptor template should contain the key origin information for
maximum compatibility with BIP-0174.

For example:

The following descriptor template and derivation path restrictions:

`wsh(sortedmulti(2,[xfpForA/87'/0'/0']XpubA/**,[xfpForB/87'/0'/0']XpubB/**))`

`/0/*,/1/*`

Expands to the two concrete descriptors:

`wsh(sortedmulti(2,[xfpForA/87'/0'/0']XpubA/0/*,[xfpForB/87'/0'/0']XpubB/0/*))`

`wsh(sortedmulti(2,[xfpForA/87'/0'/0']XpubA/1/*,[xfpForB/87'/0'/0']XpubB/1/*))`

To discover addresses, import both the receiving and change descriptors;
respect the gap limit described below.

### Address Gap Limit

Address gap limit is currently set to 20. If the software hits 20 unused
addresses in a row, it expects there are no used addresses beyond this
point and stops searching the address chain.

Wallet software should warn when the user is trying to exceed the gap
limit on an external descriptor by generating multiple unused addresses.

## Backwards Compatibility

Any script that is supported by descriptors (and the specific wallet
implementation) is compatible with this BIP.

As wallets complying with this BIP are descriptor wallets, this
therefore necessitates that the cosigners backup their private key
information and the descriptor, in order to properly restore at a later
time. This shouldn't be a user burden, since (to much user surprise),
all cosigner public keys need to be supplied in addition to `M` seeds in
any `M` of `N` multisig restore operation. The descriptor provides this
information in a standardized format, with key origin information and
error detection.

[1] **Why propose this structure only for multisignature wallets?**
Currently, single-sig wallets are able to restore funds using just the
master private key data (in the format of BIP39 usually). Even if the
user doesn't recall the derivation used, the wallet implementation can
iterate through common schemes (BIP44/49/84). With this proposed
hierarchy, the user would either have to now backup additional data (the
descriptor), or the wallet would have to attempt all script types for
every account level when restoring. Because of this, even though the
descriptor language handles the signature type just like it does the
script type, it is best to restrict this script-agnostic hierarchy to
multisignature wallets only.
