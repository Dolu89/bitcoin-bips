### Basic Pool Extensions

| template request |
|------------------|
| Key              |
| target           |

| template |
|----------|
| Key      |
| expires  |
| target   |

### Block Proposal

Servers may indicate support for proposing blocks by including a
capability string in their original template:

| template      |
|---------------|
| Key           |
| capabilities  |
| reject-reason |

If supported, a miner MAY propose a block to the server for general
validation at any point before the job expires. This is accomplished by
calling getblocktemplate with two keys:

| getblocktemplate parameters |
|-----------------------------|
| Key                         |
| data                        |
| mode                        |
| workid                      |

The block data MUST be validated and checked against the server's usual
acceptance rules (excluding the check for a valid proof-of-work). If it
is found to be in violation of any of these rules, the server MUST
return one of the following:

-   Null if it is acceptable as-is, with the same workid (if any) as
    provided. Note that this SHOULD NOT invalidate the old template's
    claim to the same workid.
-   A String giving the reason for the rejection (see [example rejection
    reasons](bip-0022.mediawiki#appendix-example-rejection-reasons "wikilink")).
-   A "delta" block template (with changes needed); in this case, any
    missing keys are assumed to default to those in the proposed block
    or, if not applicable, the original block template it was based on.
    This template MAY also include a "reject-reason" key with a String
    of the reason for rejection.

It is RECOMMENDED that servers which merely need to track the proposed
block for later share/\* submissions, return a simple Object of the
form:

`{"workid":"new workid"}`

Clients SHOULD assume their proposed block will remain valid if the only
changes they make are to the portion of the coinbase scriptSig they
themselves provided (if any) and the time header. Servers SHOULD NOT
break this assumption without good cause.

### Mutations

| template request |
|------------------|
| Key              |
| nonces           |

| template   |
|------------|
| Key        |
| maxtime    |
| maxtimeoff |
| mintime    |
| mintimeoff |
| mutable    |
| noncerange |

If the block template contains a "mutable" key, it is a list of these to
signify modifications the miner is allowed to make:

| mutations                            |
|--------------------------------------|
| Value                                |
| coinbase/append                      |
| coinbase                             |
| generation                           |
| time/increment                       |
| time/decrement                       |
| time                                 |
| transactions/add (or "transactions") |
| prevblock                            |
| version/force                        |
| version/reduce                       |

### Submission Abbreviation

| template   |
|------------|
| Key        |
| fulltarget |
| mutable    |

If the block template contains a "mutable" key, it is a list of these to
signify modifications the miner is allowed to make:

| abbreviation mutations |
|------------------------|
| Value                  |
| submit/hash            |
| submit/coinbase        |
| submit/truncate        |
| share/coinbase         |
| share/merkle           |
| share/truncate         |

#### Format of Data for Merkle-Only Shares

The format used for submitting shares with the "share/merkle" mutation
shall be the 80-byte block header, the total number of transactions
encoded in Bitcoin variable length number format, the coinbase
transaction, and then finally the little-endian SHA256 hashes of each
link in the merkle chain connecting it to the merkle root.

### Logical Services

| template request |
|------------------|
| Key              |
| capabilities     |

| template   |
|------------|
| Key        |
| serverlist |

If the "serverlist" parameter is provided, clients MAY choose to
intelligently treat the server as part of a larger single logical
service.

Each host Object in the Array is comprised of the following fields:

| serverlist element |
|--------------------|
| Key                |
| uri                |
| avoid              |
| priority           |
| sticky             |
| update             |
| weight             |

When choosing which actual server to get the next job from, URIs MUST be
tried in order of their "priority" key, lowest Number first. Where the
priority of URIs is the same, they should be chosen from in random
order, weighed by their "weight" key. Work proposals and submissions
MUST be made to the same server that issued the job. Clients MAY attempt
to submit to other servers if, and only if, the original server cannot
be reached. If cross-server share submissions are desired, services
SHOULD instead use the equivalent domain name system (DNS) features
(RFCs [1794](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1794) and
[2782](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782)).

Updates to the Logical Service server list may only be made by the
original server, or servers listed with the "update" key missing or
true. Clients MAY choose to advertise serverlist capability to servers
with a false "update" key, but if so, MUST treat the server list
provided as a subset of the current one, only considered in the context
of this server. At least one server with "update" privilege MUST be
attempted at least once daily.

If the "sticky" key is provided, then when that server is used, it
should be used consistently for at least that many seconds, if possible.

A permanent change in server URI MAY be indicated with a simple
"serverlist" parameter:

`"serverlist":[{"uri": "`[`http://newserver`](http://newserver)`"}]`

A temporary delegation to another server for 5 minutes MAY be indicated
likewise:

`"serverlist":[{"uri": "", avoid: 300}, {"uri": "`[`http://newserver`](http://newserver)`", "update": false}]`

## Motivation

There is reasonable concerns about mining currently being too
centralized on pools, and the amount of control these pools hold. By
exposing the details of the block proposals to the miners, they are
enabled to audit and possibly modify the block before hashing it.

To encourage widespread adoption, this BIP should be a complete superset
of the existing centralized getwork protocol, so pools are not required
to make substantial changes to adopt it.

## Rationale

Why allow servers to restrict the complete coinbase and nonce range?

-   This is necessary to provide a complete superset of JSON-RPC getwork
    functionality, so that pools may opt to enable auditing without
    significantly changing or increasing the complexity of their share
    validation or mining policies.
-   Since noncerange is optional (both for getwork and this BIP),
    neither clients nor servers are required to support it.

Why specify "time/\*" mutations at all?

-   In most cases, these are implied by the
    mintime/mintimecur/maxtime/maxtimecur keys, but there may be cases
    that there are no applicable minimums/maximums.

What is the purpose of the "prevblock" mutation?

-   There are often cases where a miner has processed a new block before
    the server. If the server allows "prevblock" mutation, the miner may
    begin mining on the new block immediately, without waiting for a new
    template.

Why must both "mintime"/"maxtime" and "mintimeoff"/"maxtimeoff" keys be
defined?

-   In some cases, the limits may be unrelated to the current time (such
    as the Bitcoin network itself; the minimum is always a fixed median
    time)
-   In other cases, the limits may be bounded by other rules (many pools
    limit the time header to within 5 minutes of when the share is
    submitted to them).

Is "target" really needed?

-   Some pools work with lower targets, and should not be expected to
    waste bandwidth ignoring shares that don't meet it.
-   Required to be a proper superset of getwork.
-   As mining hashrates grow, some miners may need the ability to
    request a lower target from their pools to be able to manage their
    bandwidth use.

What is the purpose of the "hash" transaction list format?

-   Non-mining tools may wish to simply get a list of memory pool
    transactions.
-   Humans may wish to view their current memory pool.
