## Abstract

This BIP describes modifications to the getblocktemplate JSON-RPC call
([BIP 22](bip-0022.mediawiki "wikilink")) to support segregated witness
as defined by [BIP 141](bip-0141.mediawiki "wikilink").

## Specification

### Block Template

The template Object is revised to include a new key:

| template    |
| ----------- |
| Key         |
| weightlimit |

The '\!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the "segwit" rule for templates
including transactions with witness data. In particular, note that even
if the client's "rules" list lacks "segwit", server MAY support old
miners by producing a witness-free template and omitting the '\!' rule
prefix for "segwit" in the template's "rules" list. If the GBT server
does not support producing witness-free templates after its activation,
it must also use the '\!' rule prefix in the "vbavailable" list prior to
activation.

#### Transactions Object Format

The Objects listed in the response's "transactions" key is revised to
include these keys:

| template "transactions" element |
| ------------------------------- |
| Key                             |
| txid                            |
| weight                          |
| hash                            |

Transactions with witness data may only be included if the template's
"rules" list (see [BIP
9](bip-0009.mediawiki#getblocktemplate_changes "wikilink")) includes
"segwit".

### Sigops

For templates with "segwit" enabled as a rule, the "sigoplimit" and
"sigops" keys must use the new values as calculated in [BIP
141](bip-0141.mediawiki#Sigops "wikilink").

### Block Assembly with Witness Transactions

When block assembly is done without witness transactions, no changes are
made by this BIP, and it should be assembled as previously.

When witness transactions are included in the block, the primary merkle
root MUST be calculated with those transactions' "txid" field instead of
"hash". A secondary merkle root MUST be calculated as per [BIP 141's
commitment structure
specification](bip-0141.mediawiki#Commitment_structure "wikilink") to be
inserted into the generation (coinbase) transaction.

Servers MUST NOT include a commitment in the "coinbasetxn" key on the
template. Clients MUST insert the commitment as an additional output at
the end of the final generation (coinbase) transaction. Only if the
template includes a "mutable" key (see [BIP 23
Mutations](bip-0023.mediawiki#Mutations "wikilink")) including
"generation", the client MAY in that case place the commitment output in
any position it chooses, provided that no later output matches the
commitment pattern.

## Motivation

Segregated witness substantially changes the structure of blocks, so the
previous getblocktemplate specification is no longer sufficient. It
additionally also adds a new way of counting resource limits, and so GBT
must be extended to convey this information correctly as well.

## Rationale

Why doesn't "weightlimit" simply redefine the existing "sizelimit"?

  - "sizelimit" is already enforced by clients by counting the sum of
    bytes in transactions' "data" keys.
  - Servers may wish to limit the overall size of a block, independently
    from the "weight" of the block.

Why is "sigoplimit" redefined instead of a new "sigopweightlimit" being
added?

  - The old limit was already arbitrarily defined, and could not be
    counted by clients on their own anyway. The concept of "sigop
    weight" is merely a change in the arbitrary formula used.

Why is "sigoplimit" divided by 4?

  - To resemble the previous values. (FIXME: is this a good reason?
    maybe we shouldn't divide it?)

Why is the witness commitment required to be added to the end of the
generation transaction rather than anywhere else?

  - Servers which do not allow modification of the generation outputs
    ought to be checking this as part of the validity of submissions. By
    requiring a specific placement, they can simply strip the commitment
    and do a byte-for-byte comparison of the outputs. Placing it at the
    end avoids the possibility of a later output matching the pattern
    and overriding it.

Why shouldn't the server simply add the commitment upfront in the
"coinbasetxn", and simply send the client stripped transaction data?

  - It would become impossible for servers to specify only
    "coinbasevalue", since clients would no longer have the information
    required to construct the commitment.
  - getblocktemplate is intended to be a \*decentralised\* mining
    protocol, and allowing clients to be blinded to the content of the
    block works contrary to that purpose.
  - BIP 23's "transactions" mutations allow the client to modify the
    transaction-set on their own, which is impossible without the
    complete transaction data.
