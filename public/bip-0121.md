## Abstract

This is a proposal for a URI scheme to be used in the Proof of Payment
process.

## Motivation

To make a Proof of Payment, the party that wants the proof needs to
transfer a Proof of Payment request to the wallet software of the other
party. To facilitate that transfer, a new URI scheme representing the
PoP request is proposed. This URI can then be encoded in QR images or be
sent over NFC in order to transfer it to the wallet.

## Specification

The specification is the same as BIP0021, with the following
differences:

-   The URI scheme is `btcpop` instead of `bitcoin`
-   The path component, i.e. the address part, is always empty.
-   A mandatory `p` parameter whose value contains the destination for
    the PoP. This could for example be a `https:` URL or a `mailto:`
    URI.
-   A mandatory `n` parameter representing the nonce, base58 encoded.
-   An optional `txid` parameter containing the Base58 encoded hash of
    the transaction to prove.

Just as in BIP0021, elements of the query component may contain
characters outside the valid range. These must first be encoded
according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8
sequence must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986.

All parameters except `p` and `n` are hints to the wallet on which
transaction to create a PoP for.

The extensibility of BIP0021 applies to this scheme as well. For
example, a `date` parameter or a `toaddr` parameter might be useful.
`req-*` parameters are also allowed and obey the same rules as in
BIP0021, clients not supporting a `req-*` parameter must consider the
URI invalid.

### Keep URIs short

Implementations should keep the URIs as short as possible. This is
because it makes QR decoding more stable. A camera with a scratched lens
or low resolution may run into problems scanning huge QR codes. This is
why the `txid` parameter is encoded in Base58 instead of the classic hex
encoded string. We get away with 44 characters instead of 64. Also, the
`nonce` parameter is Base58 encoded for the same reason.

## Interpretation

### Transaction hints

The wallet processing the URI must use the hints in the PoP request to
filter its transaction set. The `label`, `amount` and `message`
parameters must, if present in the URI, exactly match the data
associated with the original payment according to the following table:

|                         |                          |                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `btcpop:` URI parameter | `bitcoin:` URI parameter | BIP70 PaymentDetails data |
| `label`                 | `label`                  | `memo`                    |
| `amount`                | `amount`                 | `sum of outputs.amount`   |
| `message`               | `message`                | `-`                       |

The `txid` parameter value must match the transaction hash of the
payment.

After filtering, the resulting transaction set is displayed to the user
who selects one of them to prove. An implementation could also
automatically select a transaction in the filtered set, but there must
still be a way for the user to select freely among the matching
transactions. If the filtered set is empty, no transaction fits the
hints and a message about that is presented to the user. If the filtered
set contains exactly one transaction, which is preferable, that
transaction can be automatically selected.

As a fallback, there must also be a way for the user to select any
transaction from the wallet regardless of the transaction hints. This
can be useful if the metadata of the wallet is lost, possibly due to a
restore from backup.

### PoP destination `p`

The `p` parameter value is the destination where to send the PoP to.
This destination is typically a `https:` URL or a `http:` URL, but it
could be any type of URI, for example `mailto:`. To keep `btcpop:` URIs
short, users should not make their `p` parameter unnecessarily long.

#### `http:` and `https:` URLs

Wallet implementations must support the `http:` and `https:` schemes in
which case `POST` method must be used. The PoP is sent as a binary
serialized transaction. The content type of the POST request must be set
to `application/bitcoin-pop`

## Examples

Send PoP for a transaction with label "video 42923" to
https://www.example.com/pop/352, using nonce
`0x73 0xd5 0x1a 0xbb 0xd8 0x9c`:

     btcpop:?p=https://www.example.com/pop/352&n=zgWTm8yH&label=video%2042923

Send PoP through mail using mailto:pop@example.com?subject=pop444,
amount is 13370000 satoshis, nonce is `0x6f 0xe 0xfb 0x68 0x92 0xf9`.
Note that the `?` before `subject` is OK according to RFC3986, since the
query part starts from the first `?`:

     btcpop:?p=mailto:pop@example.com?subject%3Dpop444&n=xJdKmEbr&amount=0.1337

Send PoP for transaction with id
`cca7507897abc89628f450e8b1e0c6fca4ec3f7b34cccf55f3f531c659ff4d79` to
pizza place at http://pizza.example.com/pop/laszlo111 using nonce
`0xfc 0xcc 0x2c 0x35 0xf0 0xb8`

     btcpop:?p=http://pizza.example.com/pop/laszlo111&n=3AtNpVrPh&txid=Emt9MPvt1joznqHy5eEHkNtcuQuYWXzYJBQZN6BJm6NL
