## Abstract

This BIP describes a new JSON-RPC method for "smart" Bitcoin miners and
proxies. Instead of sending a simple block header for hashing, the
entire block structure is sent, and left to the miner to (optionally)
customize and assemble.

## Specification

### Block Template Request

A JSON-RPC method is defined, called "getblocktemplate". It accepts
exactly one argument, which MUST be an Object of request parameters. If
the request parameters include a "mode" key, that is used to explicitly
select between the default "template" request or a
["proposal"](bip-0023.mediawiki#Block_Proposal "wikilink").

Block template creation can be influenced by various parameters:

| template request |
| ---------------- |
| Key              |
| capabilities     |
| mode             |

getblocktemplate MUST return a JSON Object containing the following
keys:

| template          |
| ----------------- |
| Key               |
| bits              |
| curtime           |
| height            |
| previousblockhash |
| sigoplimit        |
| sizelimit         |
| transactions      |
| version           |
| coinbaseaux       |
| coinbasetxn       |
| coinbasevalue     |
| workid            |

#### Transactions Object Format

The Objects listed in the response's "transactions" key contains these
keys:

| template "transactions" element |
| ------------------------------- |
| Key                             |
| data                            |
| depends                         |
| fee                             |
| hash                            |
| required                        |
| sigops                          |

Only the "data" key is required, but servers should provide the others
if they are known.

### Block Submission

A JSON-RPC method is defined, called "submitblock", to submit potential
blocks (or shares). It accepts two arguments: the first is always a
String of the hex-encoded block data to submit; the second is an Object
of parameters, and is optional if parameters are not needed.

| submitblock parameters (2nd argument) |
| ------------------------------------- |
| Key                                   |
| workid                                |

This method MUST return either null (when a share is accepted), a String
describing briefly the reason the share was rejected, or an Object of
these with a key for each merged-mining chain the share was submitted
to.

### Optional: Long Polling

| template request |
| ---------------- |
| Key              |
| capabilities     |
| longpollid       |

| template    |
| ----------- |
| Key         |
| longpollid  |
| longpolluri |
| submitold   |

If the server supports long polling, it MUST include a "longpollid" key
in block templates, and it MUST be unique for each event: any given
"longpollid" should check for only one condition and not be reused. For
example, a server which has a long poll wakeup only for new blocks might
use the previous block hash. However, clients should not assume the
"longpollid" has any specific meaning. It MAY supply the "longpolluri"
key with a relative or absolute URI, which MAY specify a completely
different resource than the original connection, including port number.
If "longpolluri" is provided by the server, clients MUST only attempt to
use that URI for longpoll requests.

Clients MAY start a longpoll request with a standard JSON-RPC request
(in the case of HTTP transport, POST with data) and same authorization,
setting the "longpollid" parameter in the request to the value provided
by the server.

This request SHOULD NOT be processed nor answered by the server until it
wishes to replace the current block data as identified by the
"longpollid". Clients SHOULD make this request with a very long request
timeout and MUST accept servers sending a partial response in advance
(such as HTTP headers with "chunked" Transfer-Encoding), and only
delaying the completion of the final JSON response until processing.

Upon receiving a completed response:

  - Only if "submitold" is provided and false, the client MAY discard
    the results of past operations and MUST begin working on the new
    work immediately.
  - The client SHOULD begin working on the new work received as soon as
    possible, if not immediately.
  - The client SHOULD make a new request to the same long polling URI.

If a client receives an incomplete or invalid response, it SHOULD retry
the request with an exponential backoff. Clients MAY implement this
backoff with limitations (such as maximum backoff time) or any algorithm
as deemed suitable. It is, however, forbidden to simply retry
immediately with no delay after more than one failure. In the case of a
"Forbidden" response (for example, HTTP 403), a client SHOULD NOT
attempt to retry without user intervention.

### Optional: Template Tweaking

| template request |
| ---------------- |
| Key              |
| sigoplimit       |
| sizelimit        |
| maxversion       |

For "sigoplimit" and "sizelimit", negative values and zero are offset
from the server-determined block maximum. If a Boolean is provided and
true, the default limit is used; if false, the server is instructed not
to use any limits on returned template. Servers SHOULD respect these
desired maximums, but are NOT required to: clients SHOULD check that the
returned template satisfies their requirements appropriately.

### Appendix: Example Rejection Reasons

Possible reasons a share may be rejected include, but are not limited
to:

| share rejection reasons |
| ----------------------- |
| Reason                  |
| bad-cb-flag             |
| bad-cb-length           |
| bad-cb-prefix           |
| bad-diffbits            |
| bad-prevblk             |
| bad-txnmrklroot         |
| bad-txns                |
| bad-version             |
| duplicate               |
| high-hash               |
| rejected                |
| stale-prevblk           |
| stale-work              |
| time-invalid            |
| time-too-new            |
| time-too-old            |
| unknown-user            |
| unknown-work            |

## Motivation

bitcoind's JSON-RPC server can no longer support the load of generating
the work required to productively mine Bitcoin, and external software
specializing in work generation has become necessary. At the same time,
new independent node implementations are maturing to the point where
they will also be able to support miners.

A common standard for communicating block construction details is
necessary to ensure compatibility between the full nodes and work
generation software.

## Rationale

Why not just deal with transactions as hashes (txids)?

  - Servers might not have access to the transaction database, or miners
    may wish to include transactions not broadcast to the network as a
    whole.
  - Miners may opt not to do full transaction verification, and may not
    have access to the transaction database on their end.

What is the purpose of "workid"?

  - If servers allow all mutations, it may be hard to identify which job
    it is based on. While it may be possible to verify the submission by
    its content, it is much easier to compare it to the job issued. It
    is very easy for the miner to keep track of this. Therefore, using a
    "workid" is a very cheap solution to enable more mutations.

Why should "sigops" be provided for transactions?

  - Due to the [BIP 0016](bip-0016.mediawiki "wikilink") changes
    regarding rules on block sigops, it is impossible to count sigops
    from the transactions themselves (the sigops in the scriptCheck must
    also be included in the count).
