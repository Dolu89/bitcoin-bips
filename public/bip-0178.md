## Abstract

An extension to the Wallet Import Format (WIF) to specify what kind of
bitcoin address the private key corresponds to.

## Motivation

There are several types of bitcoin addresses which can all be associated
with a given private key: P2PKH (legacy `1...` format), P2SH-P2WPKH
(SegWit public key inside P2SH), P2WPKH (bech32), etc.

While private keys have a 1-byte suffix indicating whether the
corresponding public key is compressed (`0x01`) or not (through suffix
absence), there is no way of knowing what kind of bitcoin address were
associated with the private key. As a result, when importing a private
key, the wallet has to assume all kinds, and keep track of each possible
alternative.

By extending the suffix, we can specify what kind of bitcoin address was
associated with a given private key.

## Specification

Currently, private keys are stored as a uint256 (private key data)
followed by an optional uint8 (compressed flag). The latter is extended
to specify the address types:

| Value     | Type                | Compr | Clarification                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No suffix | P2PKH\_UNCOMPRESSED | No    | Uncompressed legacy public key. Unknown public key format       |
| `0x01`    | P2PKH\_COMPRESSED   | Yes   | Compressed legacy public key. Unknown public key format         |
| `0x10`    | P2PKH               | Yes   | Compressed legacy public key. Legacy public key format (`1...`) |
| `0x11`    | P2WPKH              | Yes   | Bech32 format (native Segwit)                                   |
| `0x12`    | P2WPKH\_P2SH        | Yes   | Segwit nested in BIP16 P2SH (`3...`)                            |

When a wallet imports a private key, it will have two outcomes:

  - the key is using one of the legacy types, in which case all types
    must be accounted for
  - the key is using one of the extended types, in which case the wallet
    need only track the specific corresponding address

Note: the difference between \`0x01\` and \`0x10\` is that the former
can correspond to any of the types above, whereas the latter \*only\*
corresponds to a P2PKH (legacy non-segwit).

## Compatibility

This proposal is not backwards compatible, in that software that does
not recognize the new types will not understand the compressed flag. It
would be trivial to change this, by keeping the 'uncompressed' state as
it is (no suffix) and changing 'compressed' to be 'anything not 0', as
opposed to 'the value 1'.

The proposal *is* backwards compatible in that new wallet software will
always understand the old WIF format, however. It will, as it does
today, assume that any kind of bitcoin address is possible, and will
have to track all of them, as it has to today.

## Acknowledgements

This BIP is based on the initial proposal by Thomas Voegtlin (thomasv at
electrum dot org) on the Bitcoin Dev mailing list\[1\] and the Electrum
3.0 implementation\[2\]

## Reference implementation

There is a partial implementation which adds, but does not use, the
types described in this BIP here:
